/* Purpose: Calculating pre- & post-COVID annualized Ã¬nlation rate; Creating scatterplot showing the relationship between pre-COVID and post-COVID inflation rates; Creating Kdensity showing the relationship between pre-COVID and post-COVID inflation rates; Creating summarize table of pre- and post-COVID inflation rates showing mean, standard deviation, variance, median, 5th percentile, 95th percentile

* Calculating the pre- & post-COVID annualized inflation rate using RPP and PCE
* Keeping data for relevant years

* Merge with PCE data

reshape wide inf, i(GeoFIPS) j(Year)
